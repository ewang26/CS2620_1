# Engineering Notebook

- Crafted an initial design of the protocol, done with efficiency of the number of bits in mind. However, I'm not sure if the current protocol leads to unnecessary interface calls. Planning to revisit the design with this in mind.

- After getting a basic code structure down, returned back to the requirements and started crafting a design doc to help guide the implementation.

- Tried to start by just writing some code and getting the first four requires (creating accounts, logging in, listing accounts, and sending messages) working. The intent was to get a good feel of the problem at hand and try and find any potential issues early on.

**TODO**: @Eric add some notes about your first steps
